README: 
I'm using glm to implement 3D Linear Algebra. 
Shader has been passed the light position as an uniform in initializeGL(). 
Spinning cube: click the start rotation button to start and the end rotation button
	to stop. 
Spherical camera and Interactivity: to use, press the arrow keys to move around, i 
	key to zoom in, and o key to zoom out. 

Extra Credit: 
Implemented the equivalent of glm's lookAt function in the camera class as the 
	calcViewMatrix function. 
Implemented mouse movement: Click and drag to move cube. Scroll to zoom in/out. 
	Please test this independent of the keyPressEvent method.

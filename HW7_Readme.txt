HW7 Readme: 

There are lists on the right, listing faces, half edges, and vertices. 
Click a vertex in the Vertices list and use the x, y, z sliders to move it around.
Click on a face in the Faces list and use the Red, Green, Blue sliders to change
	the color of the faces. 
Click on a half edge in the Half Edges list and click the "Add a Vertex into an 
	Edge" button and it'll ad a vertex into that half edge (not noticeable until
	you move the new vertex around). 
Select/Highlight two half edges and click "Add Edge Between Two Faces" to add an 
	edge between the selected two half edges' faces. (also noticeable until
	you move the new associated vertex around). 
Click on a face in the Faces list and click "Split Quad" and it'll split into two
	triangles if the face has 4 associated half edges. 
Click on a half edge in the list and click "Remove Vertex" and it'll delete the
	vertex associated to that half edge and remove the adjacent faces to that
	vertex. 




There are still dangling vertices but someone on Piazza said that it's ok for now.
